# BLU09 - Information Extraction and Advanced Text Classification Techniques

## What is in this BLU?

This big learning unit continues the text classification specialization. Now that you know how to process text and extract meaningfull features, we will show you how to prepare these features so you can actually use them for your task, for example text classification.

We will focus on how to go from a huge set of features to a more tractable set, more usefull for the modelling of our problem.

If you are able to solve this BLU, you are equiped with one more set of tools to succeed in the hackathon :)

## How to use this repo

As in the previous BLUs, go through the Learning Notebooks (they are in the Learning Notebooks folder), then do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on the portal.
