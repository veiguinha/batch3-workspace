# batch3-BLU10 - Non Personalized Recommender Systems

## What is in this BLU?

In this learning unit, we learn about Recommender Systems, NumPy, SciPy and non-personalized recommendations.
While doing it, we build the required framework and the skillset to tackle more complex problems later in the course.

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch3-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
Don't forget to create a new conda environment using the `environment.yml` file for this BLU!
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's three of them).
1. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.
1. Checkout the Appendix Notebook whenever you need or want to know more about RecSys.

## "I need help understanding something."
You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please check out the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/How-to-ask-for-and-give-help), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
