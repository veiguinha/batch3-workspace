    "\n",
    "You've already learned quite a bit about how to do Data Analysis. In SLU01, SLU02, SLU03, SLU04, and SLU05 you have a nice pile of tools that you can use to get a feel for the type of data that you are dealing with. Use them until you feel comfortable enough that you could confidently describe the most important characteristics of the data set you are working with.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your data analysis will certainly uncover data problems. Some of these data problems you may be able to deal with once and others you may need to make part of a pipeline. An example of a data problem that you would deal with once at the beginning of your workflow is changing numbers that are stored as strings in a csv into actual numbers. An example of something that you might want to put off until later is filling in nans so that you could experiment with imputation strategies.\n",

    "Once you've got some clean data and have a benchmark model as a reference you may want to create some new features out of the existing features.

Examples of these are features that are all unique, all one value, are leakage, or are disallowed by law. Examples of features that you may want to remove at a later stage are because you found out that they are redundant or don't have any predictive power.\n",
