# Small Learning Unit 19 - Workflow

This is a learning unit that is mostly just a presentation of best practices and workflow steps. It is meant
to act more as a reference than as something that teaches technical tools. There is no presentation for this
LU because the Learning notebook itself is mostly a presentation.

While the Learning notebook follow the curriculum, the Examples notebook deviates from most of the other
LUs in that it actually introduces a good number of new concepts that don't really have much to do with
Data Science directly but rather programming practices that, should you master, will allow you to spend
more time doing DS and less time being frustrated and debugging code.
